# Scoreboard Stats Import ![supports fabric 1.21](https://img.shields.io/badge/supports-fabric%201.21-informational)

Did you just start a new Minecraft multiplayer server and forget to create a scoreboard objective for each of the 5,000
statistics you want to track so now the leaderboards are permanently ruined? Yeah me too.

Well great news, every time you create a new scoreboard objective, this mod will now scan through every statistics file
on your server and import the specified statistic data into your new objective.

There is no configuring or disabling the mod. If there's a specific objective you *don't* want to import old data into,
just run `/scoreboard players reset * objectiveNameHere` after you create it and the mod finishes importing the data.
